# Hi, I'm Behrad ðŸ‘‹
**Pronouns:** he/him


I'm a first year PhD student, undertaking a project in collaboration with Siemens MobilityÂ on "Artificial Intelligence and Mechanism Design for Optimal Routing of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles". I am supervised by Dr Stein and Dr Gerding within the School of Electronics and Computer ScienceÂ at the University of Southampton. Prior to undertaking a PhD, I graduated from the University of Southampton with aÂ BSc in Computer Science.Â In my third year as an undergraduate, I worked with a local hospital to create a new matching algorithm for allocation of doctors and clinical staff to radiotherapy patients.

I'm particularly interested in machine learning, game theory and mechanism design in the area of intelligent traffic systems.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Reinforcement learning and neural information learning (primarily graph neural networks) and for traffic light management. This includes comparing and evaluating existing state of the art solutions and their unintended impacts on traffic networks.
- Intention aware traffic management; Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), and Electric Vehicles (EVs) are likely to become commonplace in the next decade, and management of resources such as road networks and charging locations could vastly improve the experience of road users whilst yielding particularly interesting technology.
- [wessex.live](https://wessex.live); I represent the University of Southampton Hockey Club and I have setup and maintained wessex.live, a customised link shortener which allows our players to navigate the needlessly complex websites used by Hampshire Hockey Association and BUCs.
